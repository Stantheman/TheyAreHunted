{"name":"Theyarehunted","body":"TheyAreHunted\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis script downloads every song from the emerging section of wearehunted.com. Tested on Debian, but should work with any flavor of Linux (probably Macs too).  \r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n * Tracks the songs it downloads to save bandwidth (no duplicates!) \r\n * Designed for cron and works fine manually too\r\n * Tags the downloaded file with the title, artist, and a comment with the original date pulled and source URL\r\n * Replaces non-safe filename characters with underscores in the filename\r\n * Prints to the terminal only when being run by hand \r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTheyAreHunted is a perl script and uses the following non-standard modules:\r\n\r\n * MP3::Tag\r\n * LWP::UserAgent\r\n * JSON\r\n\r\nIf you're using Debian or Ubuntu, you can install the required package with this line: \r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libmp3-tag-perl libwww-perl libjson-perl\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can install these using your favorite method to install perl modules. If you don't have a favorite method, try cpanm:\r\n\r\n    curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus\r\n\tcpanm --sudo MP3::Tag LWP::UserAgent JSON\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTheyAreHunted will run with no parameters, ie:\r\n\r\n    perl getsongs.pl\r\n\r\nThis will download the top 99 songs from the front page of WeAreHunted, to a directory called *./wearehunted_songs*. If you'd rather the files go to a different directory, tell the script:\r\n\r\n    perl getsongs.pl /home/user/put/songs/here\r\n\r\nYou can use this line for a weekly cronjob. Since the script maintains a list of downloaded songs, you'll only get the new songs.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere's a few notes:\r\n\r\n * The songs are all 128kbps quality. If that's a problem, you should probably be buying your music.\r\n * Be nice to WeArehunted. They're really awesome. If you slam their servers, they'll either ban you or everyone.\r\n * This script is provided for educational purposes only. I don't take any responsibility for anything you do with this.\r\n * The script inserts the date the song was scraped into the comments tag. It would be neat to graph the rate of new songs per *cronjob period* over time.\r\n * Isn't the project name hilarious? I think so.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Stan Schwertly\r\n\r\nhttp://www.schwertly.com\r\n","tagline":"Automatically download WeAreHunted songs all the time","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
